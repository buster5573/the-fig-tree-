<h2>I'm actually hungry</h2><img src="https://st3.depositphotos.com/1083268/14518/v/600/depositphotos_145186997-stock-illustration-fig-tree-botanical-illustration.jpg"width=70% alt="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-llpSNDVOt-8/TVs-ghHZoQI/AAAAAAAAEno/_j7ZwnNZ1Wg/s1600/fig_plant_25811_lg.gif"width=70%>
<p>Esther has this disturbing vision while out on a date with Constantin, who's giving her a tour of the U.N. Being surrounded by all these accomplished, multilingual young people prompts Esther to start mentally listing all the things she's terrible at. She berates herself on her own flaws (she can't cook, she doesn't know shorthand, she's a bad dancer) until she spirals into the fig tree metaphor, sure that she will never live up to her promise as a gifted, scholarship kid.</p>
<p>Then, however, Constantin takes her to a restaurant, and Esther has to sit down and eat. Then, there's this:</p>
  <p>"I don't know what I ate, but I felt immensely better after the first mouthful. It occurred to me that my vision of the fig tree and all the fat figs that withered and fell to earth might well have arisen from the profound void of an empty stomach."
<p>She was hungry.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn't mean that the fig tree wasn't a genuine expression of her fears, or that a single sandwich has cured Esther of all her emotional anguish â€” but it's an important moment all the same. Plath isn't presenting us with a withering fig tree as the inevitable end to all young people with promise. She's showing us a young woman in great pain, who sometimes forgets to do things like eat. Esther's fears are valid, but the book is not about her succumbing to fear. It's about her slowly, steadily finding her feet again, one sandwich at a time.</p>
