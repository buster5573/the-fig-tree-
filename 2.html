<p>The fig tree is an apt image for all those moments of indecisive panic. It's a good quote. But there are so many other metaphors in The Bell Jar that so rarely get quoted. Esther is often told that, in relationships, the man is the arrow and the woman is "the place the arrow shoots from." Six pages after the fig tree quote, she thinks to herself:</p>
  <p>"The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket."</p>
<p>And then, of course, there's the very end of the book, when Esther leaves the hospital, excited at the prospect of meeting her own future:</p>
  <p>"My stocking seams were straight, my black shoes cracked, but polished, and my red wool suit flamboyant as my plans. Something old, something new... But I wasn't getting married. There ought, I thought, to be a ritual for being born twiceâ€”patched, retreaded and approved for the road..."</p>
<p>Because no matter how Sylvia Plath's own life may have ended, Esther will not starve to death in the crotch of the fig tree.</p>
